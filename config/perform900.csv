# tail sends 900 result messages to clients.  check for this in the log.
#  Sample commands to use, assuming tail's log is in tail.log and log entry
#  for sending a result message contains the string "result_message":
#  linux, mac os: grep --count result_message tail.log
#  windows (in PowerShell): find /C `"result_message`" tail.log

# FAILURE SCENARIO
# no failures
# MAPPING OF PROCESSES TO HOSTS
# to simplify changing the hosts, we first specify a semicolon-separated
# list of hosts, and then use 0-based indices into that list to specify the
# host on which each process runs.
# list of hosts used in this scenario
hosts = localhost; 192.168.0.3; 192.168.0.4
# host on which each client runs.  in this example, client 0 runs
# on host 1, clients 1 and 2 run on host 0.
client_hosts = 0; 1; 0
# host on which each replica runs.  same in all configurations.
